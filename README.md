# Display Refresh Rate Analyzer

## Overview

The **Display Refresh Rate Analyzer** is a free, web-based tool designed to test and analyze the performance of your monitor. This tool can help you evaluate your display's refresh rate, frame timings, animation performance, and input latency. It's perfect for gamers, developers, and anyone looking to test their monitor's performance to ensure smooth visual experiences.

## Features

- **Monitor Refresh Rate Detection**: Automatically detect and display the refresh rate of your monitor.
- **Frame Timing Analysis**: Measure and visualize how frames are rendered over time.
- **Animation Performance Testing**: Test and analyze how well animations are displayed on your screen.
- **Input Latency Measurement**: Measure the delay between user input and the screen update.
- **Frame Consistency Scoring**: Check how consistently frames are rendered, ensuring smoothness and reducing stuttering.

## FAQ

### 1. **What is a refresh rate?**

The refresh rate is the number of times per second that a display's image is refreshed. It is measured in Hertz (Hz). A higher refresh rate leads to smoother visuals and is especially important for gaming.

### 2. **How does this tool measure frame timing?**

Frame timing is measured by tracking the time between successive frames being rendered by the display. This tool uses JavaScript to analyze the interval between frames and provide insights into your display's performance.

### 3. **Can I use this tool on mobile devices?**

While the tool is primarily optimized for desktop monitors, it can be used on mobile devices. However, results may vary, and we recommend using a desktop for accurate testing.

### 4. **What does the frame consistency score mean?**

The frame consistency score indicates how evenly the frames are rendered over time. A high score means smoother motion without stuttering or dropped frames.
